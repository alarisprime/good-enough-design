# About the Workshop

Designing and developing responsive web is still a mystery for many teams. Through this workshop, you will learn to create a “Good Enough Design” system. The workshop includes exercises on conceptualizing a product idea, creating user flows, designing modular interfaces, to building a custom living style guide that works across devices – phones, tablets, desktops or TVs.

Through smart choices we can speed up the design phase. Through a living style guide we can speed up the development. The style guide also helps to maintain and scale your web app without breaking your team’s brains.

All this will help you to spend the energy – wasted on fights between your development and design teams – on making a better product.

The crux of the workshop is inspired by the super concise book “It depends” by [Trent Walton](https://twitter.com/trentwalton).

Yes, _“it depends”_. That would be the answer if you ask the popular question – “What design process should we use for the ‘X’ product?” – to any of the product designers. In the course of the workshop we will walk you through on how to expand all the ‘it depends’ for the product your are going to build.

## Who should attend

Any member from your team who deals with the direction of the product will be benefited from this workshop. They will get better understanding with responsive design and design systems. A hidden motive behind the workshop is to reduce gap between the designers and developers. So those super stars from your team are a must.
