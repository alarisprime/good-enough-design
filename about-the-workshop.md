The crux of the workshop is inspired by the super conscise book “It depends” by [Trent Walton](https://twitter.com/trentwalton).

Yes, _“it depends”_. That would be the answer if you ask the popular question – “What design process should we use for the ‘X’ product?” – to any of the product designers. In the course of the workshop we will walk you through on how to expand all the ‘it depends’ for the product your are going to build.
