De­sign­ing and de­vel­op­ing re­spon­sive web is still a mys­tery for many teams. Through this work­shop, you will learn to cre­ate a “Good Enough De­sign” sys­tem. The work­shop in­cludes ex­er­cises on con­cep­tu­al­iz­ing a prod­uct idea, cre­at­ing user flows, de­sign­ing mod­u­lar in­ter­faces, to build­ing a cus­tom liv­ing style guide that works across de­vices – phones, tablets, desk­tops or TVs.

Through smart choices we can speed up the de­sign phase. Through a liv­ing style guide we can speed up the de­vel­op­ment. The style guide also helps to main­tain and scale your web app with­out break­ing your team’s brains.

All this will help you to spend the en­ergy – wasted on fights be­tween your de­vel­op­ment and de­sign teams – on mak­ing a bet­ter prod­uct.
