# Introduction

The crux of the workshop is inspired by the super conscise book “It depends” by [Trent Walton](https://twitter.com/trentwalton).

_Yes. It depends._ That would be the answer to your question – “What design process should we use for the ‘X’ product?” – to any product designers. In the course of the workshop we will walk you through on how to expand all the ‘it depends’ for the product your are going to build.
